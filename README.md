Using a NN to play Rock Paper Scissors

Im currently going through a bunch of youtube tutorials. Using Sklearn and tensorflow to create a bunch of different ML models. 
We can see if we wanna do any of them from scratch. Just dicking around and learning about the different model types. 

The tutorial I am following

### Linear Regression
Make sure to set RETRAIN to true before running LinearRegression.py to generate your best fit model.
Set it to false afterwards

Use linear regression when data has a noticable correlation. AKA MX+B best fit line situation. 

### k Nearest neighbor
No idea what the hell this is....
